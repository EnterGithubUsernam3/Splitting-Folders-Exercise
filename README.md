# Splitting-Folders-Exercise
This is an exercise in which we produce 10 text files , for 100,500,1000 folders of random sizes from 1MB - 1 TB . We need to split these folders to disks of total capacity of 1TB with two methodolies.The greedy and the greedy descending . After that we need to compare the results for each sample size.
The Disk.js file  is the model of the disks that we create.
The MaxPq.js is the file that produces the random folders for different sample sizes.
The FileReaderFunction.js is a file that read the text files with the folders sizes and push those folders into an array.
The Greedy.Js file is the file that we split the folders to disks using the greedy methodology .
Lastly the comparisson file is the programm that runs both of the methods for the 10 text files of different folders sizes and comparing the results.
